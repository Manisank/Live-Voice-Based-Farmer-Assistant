    "what is crop rotation": "Crop rotation is the practice of growing different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons to maintain soil fertility and reduce pests.",
    "how to improve soil fertility": "You can improve soil fertility by adding organic matter like compost, using cover crops, and practicing crop rotation.",
    "what is the best fertilizer for wheat": "The best fertilizer for wheat is one that provides nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in balanced proportions.",
    "what is organic farming": "Organic farming is a method of farming that avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, focusing on natural processes to grow crops and raise animals.",
    "what is precision farming": "Precision farming uses technology like GPS and sensors to monitor and optimize agricultural practices for better efficiency and yield.",
    "what is sustainable agriculture": "Sustainable agriculture focuses on farming practices that meet current food needs without compromising future generations' ability to produce food.",
    "how to conserve water in agriculture": "Water can be conserved by using drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and soil mulching to retain moisture.",
    "what is pest management": "Pest management involves controlling pests using techniques like crop rotation, natural predators, and minimal use of pesticides.",
    "what are cover crops": "Cover crops are plants like clover or rye grown to protect and improve soil health during off-seasons.",
    "what are cash crops": "Cash crops are grown for sale rather than personal consumption, such as cotton, coffee, or sugarcane.",
    "how does climate change affect farming": "Climate change can alter rainfall patterns, increase temperatures, and lead to extreme weather, affecting crop yields and farming practices.",
    "what are high-yield varieties": "High-yield varieties are genetically developed crops that produce more food per acre than traditional varieties.",
    "what is the green revolution": "The Green Revolution refers to the 20th-century agricultural movement that increased food production worldwide through the use of high-yield crops, fertilizers, and irrigation.",
    "what is aquaponics": "Aquaponics is a sustainable method of farming that combines aquaculture (fish farming) with hydroponics (soilless plant cultivation).",
    "what is hydroponics": "Hydroponics is a farming method that grows plants in nutrient-rich water rather than soil.",
    "what is the difference between organic and conventional farming": "Organic farming avoids synthetic chemicals and focuses on natural methods, while conventional farming uses fertilizers, pesticides, and modern equipment for higher yields.",
    "what is vermicomposting": "Vermicomposting is the process of using earthworms to convert organic waste into nutrient-rich compost for plants.",
    "what are gmos": "GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) are organisms whose DNA has been altered for specific traits, such as pest resistance or improved yield.",
    "what is integrated pest management": "Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an eco-friendly approach to controlling pests using a combination of biological, cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.",
    "what is agroforestry": "Agroforestry is the practice of growing trees and shrubs alongside crops and livestock to enhance biodiversity and sustainability.",
    "how to reduce soil erosion": "Soil erosion can be reduced by planting cover crops, practicing no-till farming, and building terraces on slopes.",
    "what are the benefits of no-till farming": "No-till farming prevents soil erosion, improves soil structure, and increases water retention by leaving crop residues on the field.",
    "what is sustainable livestock farming": "Sustainable livestock farming involves practices that minimize environmental impact, improve animal welfare, and ensure long-term productivity.",
    "what is the importance of crop diversity": "Crop diversity enhances resilience to pests, diseases, and climate change while improving soil health and productivity.",
    "how to control weeds naturally": "Weeds can be controlled naturally using mulching, crop rotation, hand weeding, or introducing weed-eating animals.",
    "what are biofertilizers": "Biofertilizers are natural fertilizers made from microorganisms that enhance soil fertility and plant growth.",
    "what is monocropping": "Monocropping is the practice of growing a single crop over a large area, which can lead to soil depletion and pest issues.",
    "what is intercropping": "Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops together on the same field to maximize resource use and reduce pest damage.",
    "what are the benefits of organic matter in soil": "Organic matter improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and microbial activity.",
    "what is regenerative agriculture": "Regenerative agriculture focuses on practices that restore and enhance soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem functions.",
    "how to test soil quality": "Soil quality can be tested by analyzing pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter content using soil testing kits or laboratories.",
    "what are polyhouse farming benefits": "Polyhouse farming provides a controlled environment for crops, improving yield, reducing pest attacks, and enabling year-round cultivation.",
    "what is companion planting": "Companion planting involves growing different crops together to enhance growth, deter pests, and improve yields.",
    "how to prevent crop diseases": "Crop diseases can be prevented by using disease-resistant varieties, practicing crop rotation, and maintaining proper field hygiene.",
    "what is the importance of irrigation": "Irrigation ensures crops get enough water for optimal growth, especially in areas with insufficient rainfall.",
    "what is aquaculture": "Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic organisms for food production."
